# Final code explainï¼š
What I created is a game designed for ducks. Players can click on the screen to shoot down the ducks that fly out of the screen. The ducks will have sound effects when they fly out and when the player shoots. In addition, I also designed a dll to increase the flying speed of the duck.

This is the time it takes for the duck to come out and the code for how the player shoots down the duck.

This is about the controller of the duck, and after the player shoots down the duck, the duck will fall over

This is the screen of the game. Because the duck and the cloud are on different layers, the duck will be covered when flying over the cloud to increase the difficulty of the game.

I also encountered some problems. For example, I turned the mouse into an aiming icon but it didn't work. Also, I added a sound to the game and I made the correct settings, but it didn't work either.
