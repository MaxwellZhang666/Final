# Final code explainï¼š
What I created is a game designed for ducks. Players can click on the screen to shoot down the ducks that fly out of the screen. The ducks will have sound effects when they fly out and when the player shoots. In addition, I also designed a dll to increase the flying speed of the duck.

This is the time it takes for the duck to come out and the code for how the player shoots down the duck.
